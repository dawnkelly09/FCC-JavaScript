Profile Lookup 

Problem: 

We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.

A lookUpProfile function that takes name and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.

The function should check if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.

If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.

If name does not correspond to any contacts then return the string No such contact.

If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match name then return the string No such property.

Solution:

// Setup
var contacts = [
    {
        "firstName": "Akira",
        "lastName": "Laine",
        "number": "0543236543",
        "likes": ["Pizza", "Coding", "Brownie Points"]
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Harry",
        "lastName": "Potter",
        "number": "0994372684",
        "likes": ["Hogwarts", "Magic", "Hagrid"]
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Sherlock",
        "lastName": "Holmes",
        "number": "0487345643",
        "likes": ["Intriguing Cases", "Violin"]
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Kristian",
        "lastName": "Vos",
        "number": "unknown",
        "likes": ["JavaScript", "Gaming", "Foxes"]
    }
];


function lookUpProfile(name, prop) {
  // Only change code below this line

/* starting at 0, as long as x < number of contacts, increment x by 1 each time*/  
for (let x = 0; x < contacts.length; x++) {

/*if first name passed to function matches a first name in the contact list, then check for property (prop) passed to the function*/ 

    if (contacts[x].firstName === name) {
      if (contacts[x].hasOwnProperty(prop)) {

/*if both check are true, then*/
        return contacts[x][prop];

/*if no matching prop is found*/
      } else {
        return "No such property";
      }
    }
  }

/*if no matching name is found, return "No such contact" & prop check does not happen*/

  return "No such contact";
}
  // Only change code above this line


lookUpProfile("Akira", "likes");
