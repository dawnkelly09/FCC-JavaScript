Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.

Solution:

function mutation(arr) {

//1st we will make both items lower case
//the 2nd element is named test because we are testing to see if all of those characters
//are in the 1st element (aka target in this example)

  let test = arr[1].toLowerCase();
  let target = arr[0].toLowerCase();

//now that it's all lowercase, we can use for loop to compare character by character
//The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found 
//in the array, or -1 if it is not present. So any non-match will kick back -1 and 
//return false. If all match, true will return. Magic! 

  for (let i = 0; i < test.length; i++) {
    if (target.indexOf(test[i]) < 0) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
