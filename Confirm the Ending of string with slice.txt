Confirm the Ending

Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).

This challenge can be solved with the .endsWith() method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.

Solution:

function confirmEnding(str, target) {

//use slice to copy the string: requires 2 parameters a start point and end point
//Subtract the target length from the string length to create the starting point
//With no designated end point, slice will run to the end of the string
// the === compares that last part of the string to the target

return str.slice(str.length - target.length) === target;
  
}

confirmEnding("Bastian", "n");
