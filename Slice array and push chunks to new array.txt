Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.

Solution:

function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {

//1st create newArr to hold the chunks we make
  let newArr = [];

//Now use a for loop to iterate through the array
//Loop starts at 0 (the first element in array)
//Loop is creating indices to tell us where to slice the array
//Loop increments by whatever # is stored in size (determines size of chunks)

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += size) {

//Chunks are made using slice->syntax slice(start, end)
//Push each chunk to our new array

    newArr.push(arr.slice(i, i + size));
  }
  return newArr;
}
