Return Largest Numbers in Arrays

Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.


function largestOfFour(arr) {

//create a variable to store results as an array

  let results = [];

//This outer for loop will iterate through the outer array

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

//This second variable will be updated to hold whatever the current longest number is

    let largestNumber = arr[i][0];

//This nested for loop will iterate through the inner/individual arrays
//Each number will be checked against current largest stored number and will replace if it is larger

    for (let j = 1; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
      if (arr[i][j] > largestNumber) {

//The final largest number is stored with it's position inside the nested array
//[i] will be position re: in group 0, 1, 2 etc
//[j] will be index position within the individual subarray

        largestNumber = arr[i][j];
      }
    }
    results[i] = largestNumber;
  }

  return results;
}
