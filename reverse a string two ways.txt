Reverse the provided string.

You may need to turn the string into an array before you can reverse it.

Your result must be a string.

Two ways to solve:

Method 1: use built in functions

//chain together split, reverse, and join functions
//will split string into an array of individual characters then
//will reverse the characters in the array then
//will join the characters back together into a string


function reverseString(str) {
  return str
    .split("")
    .reverse()
    .join("");
}
reverseString("hello");

Method 2: use a for loop

//reversedStr is starting out blank
//by using str.length-1, tells the loop to start from the end of the string
//decrementing each iteration moves one character closer to start of string each time
//+= str[i] is adding each character to reversedStr as loop iterates

function reverseString(str) {
  for (var reversedStr = "", i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversedStr += str[i];
  }
  return reversedStr;
}
