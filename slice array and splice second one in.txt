Slice and Splice

You are given two arrays and an index.

Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.

Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.

Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.

Solution:

function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {

//first use slice to copy arr2 and assign it to a variable so it doesn't get mutated

  let localArray = arr2.slice();

//use for loop to iterate through arr1 and splice each element into localArray (copy of arr2)
//increment after each pass to go through all of arr1

  for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    localArray.splice(n, 0, arr1[i]);
    n++;
  }

//localArray should now return as the copy of arr2 with the arr1 elements spliced in
//original arr2 has not change in any way because we made copy and worked with the copy

  return localArray;
}
