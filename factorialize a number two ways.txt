Factorialize a Number

Remember:

1) formula for factorial is: factorial(n)=n∗factorial(n−1)
2) the factorial of 0 = 1

Two methods-

Method 1: iterative approach



function factorial(n){

//this first section takes care of cases where we know the answer is 1

  let answer = 1;
  if (n == 0 || n == 1){
    return answer;

//else statement to deal with the rest of our positive numbers
//this loop will check to see if number is greater than one 
//if it is >1, then adds it to the factorial equation and decrements to go to next number
//remember: answer initially = 1 so first time through it will be 1 * i
//the new value becomes the new answer and the loop repeats until it gets to 1

  }else{
    for(var i = n; i >= 1; i--){
      answer = answer * i;
    }
    return answer;
  }  
}


Method 2: recursive approach

function factorial(n){
 
//base case - this is what will exit the function when it's reached

    if(n == 0 || n == 1){
        return 1;


 //recursive case - this is a condensed version of the statement used in our for loop example

    }else{
        return n * factorial(n-1);
    }
}

NOTE: the recursive method is shorter code but takes longer to run as each case is stored in the stack until the whole thing is run
