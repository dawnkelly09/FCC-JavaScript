Find the Longest Word in a String

Problem: Return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence. Your response should be a number.

Three Methods to Solve

Method 1: use a For Loop

//will use the split() method--> be sure to put an empty space between the parenthesis
//Needs to look like split(' ') to keep the words together or it will make individual letters

function findLongestWord(str) {

//use the split method to split sentence into an array of indiv words
  var strSplit = str.split(' ');

//set longestWord var = to 0 to start the loop

  var longestWord = 0;

//start with length of zero, run while string length is < the longest string, incriment each time

  for(var i = 0; i < strSplit.length; i++){

//if string is longer than the one it is compared to, assign it as the new value for longestWord

    if(strSplit[i].length > longestWord){
	longestWord = strSplit[i].length;
     }
  }
  return longestWord;
}


Method 2: use Sort method

//The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.
//Because uppercase comes before lower case in Unicode, we have to use oredering criterion

function findLongestWord(str) {

//First split string into array of strings, remember the empty space in parenthesis!

var strSplit = str.split(' ');

//Sort the elements in the array --> will compare a word to be word, longest comes to front

var longestWord = strSplit.sort(function(a, b) { 
    return b.length - a.length;
});

//return the the length of the first element in the array

  return longestWord[0].length;
}

Method 3: use Reduce() method

function findLongestWord(str) {

//Split the string into array of strings. Remember the empty space!

var strSplit = str.split(' ');

//use the reduce method
//the empty string "" at the end serves as the starting point for comparison
//Compares first element in array to empty string, assigns yes to longest and keeps
//that element for the next comparison. Last element assigned yes is returned

var longestWord = strSplit.reduce(function(longest, currentWord) {
    if(currentWord.length > longest.length)
       return currentWord;
    else
       return longest;
  }, "");
